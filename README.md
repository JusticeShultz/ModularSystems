# Modular Systems
This project is a collection of modular scripts for a generic RPG game in Unity3D. I will be adding to this over time as I find the need, the idea behind this project is that a designer could simply pull this project, slap some components on an object and have a working enemy, player, npc, etc quickly and effectively.
